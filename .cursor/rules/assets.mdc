# Assets Directory Structure

The `src/assets` directory contains static assets such as images used in the application.

- [img/](mdc:src/assets/img): Contains image files (e.g., logo.svg, Vector.png) for use in UI components.

## Usage
- Place static assets (images, icons, etc.) in this directory or its subdirectories.
- Reference assets in your components using relative import paths.
