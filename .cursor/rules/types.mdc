# Types Directory Structure

The `src/types` directory contains TypeScript type definitions shared across the project.

- [payment.ts](mdc:src/types/payment.ts): Defines types related to payments.
- [index.ts](mdc:src/types/index.ts): Main type export or aggregation file.

## Usage

- Add new files here for additional type definitions.
- Import types from this directory to ensure type safety across your codebase.
